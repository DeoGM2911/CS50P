###################################
Note: + not all attributes of vehicle (or Car and motorbike) would be used, this class try to encapsulate all
properties (or useful ones) of a vehicle (or a car or a motorbike)
      + I don't have the plate as a property as the plate would be generated

* for vehicle.py:
- the class vehicle will have the following properties:
+ the power of the vehicle: float (HP)
+ the volume of cylinder: float (cm^3)
+ max torsion: int (rounds/min)
+ mass of the vehicle: float (tons)
+ price (tax not included): round to an int (in USD)
+ method: qualified: check whether the user can use the vehicle (checking the cylinder's volume)

- the class car will have:
+ tax: float (percent) based on the price
+ property: capacity: int (people)
+ class constant: list of cities that have different car registration fees
+ method: get_price_car: give the total price based on the conditions.
+ method type_of_car: find the type of car: big/small family car, truck/contruction cars

- the class vehicle will have:
+ tax: float (percent) based on the price
+ class constant: list of motorbike's prices that govern the registration fee
+ method: get_price_motorbike: give the total price based on the conditions.
