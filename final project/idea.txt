#The project is a simple model governing a bike shop.
* Related content:
- OOP
- Database (SQLite3)

*Goals:
+ Govern the database containing buyers info. and the bikes in the storage
+ Help search for the desired bike.

* Note: 
+ This is a simplified version; in other words, an application should still be develop and the Python programs in
this project would be implemented in the app.
+ I can also use libraries like tkinder to help with UX design. However, I want to focus on designing the database and 
the Bikes class along with some functions that help with govern the database

I came up this idea for the final project for CS50P.
