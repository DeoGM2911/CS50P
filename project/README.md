### 2. **Description**:
#### 2.1 *Overview*:
    - The project's name is Vplate, which stands for Vehicle's plate and Viet plate. The name was inspired by the license plate system in my home country Vietnam.
    - The project's aims are to create a program that:
    + Help users check their desired license plate (in reality, Vietnam doesn't allow this; however, inspired by the plate problem in problem set 2, I decided to add this feature so that anyone can have their wanted plate).
    + Randomly generate one for them (if they don't have a desired plate).
    + Printing out the users' and their vehicles' details (after they've inputted their information).
    + Printing the price of buying and registrating the vehicle (also show the price components).
     + In the process of inputting data, the program will also check whether the user is 18 year old. (in Vietnam, the minimal age to buy a vehicle legally is 18)
