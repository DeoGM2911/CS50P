These are my takes on the problems in the course CS50P.
If anyone detect a bug, please notify me. Thank you!

P/S 1: I'm not taking the course for a certificate but rather as a measure of my comprehension
of Python language which I have learn through a "newbie" course before.

P/S 2: Please treat this as a reference material if you're taking the course.
Being able to solve hard problems is the best feeling. =)
